# Partnership_Sort_NeoTech


# Currently, we select the latest Neotech file and then the previous one 

    -We need to fix the issue where we need to check the latest neotechfile 
    
    -Ideally, once the process is completed for the last week file we can bring over the new VLOOKUP'ed columns 
    and bring them over
    
    -I need the week of 8.18 contract to have the Dupes Removed Sheet, with the VLOOKUP columns from the 8.04 
    contract in order to bring them into the next contract being 9.01

    - We need to make it so no matter what the Dupes Removed or in our case Full Fle Without Dupes is created to then use the rest of our functions accordingly
    
    - Currently I can rename the 9.01 first sheet to 'Sheet1' to mock the 9.18 one, then delete the Dupes Removed, once I did this I can run my program on it and I dont need to drop those columns commented out in my code 
      I dont need to drop these anymore because in our latest file those columns aren't there anymore 

    - Now that I have the columns I need in the latest NeoTech file I can choose the latest one to merge the files into

    - Basically all we need is to setup 8.18 the same way 8.04 is setup
