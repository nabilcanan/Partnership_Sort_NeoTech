## Partnership_Sort_Neotech
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________


# This program will allow us to perform the following tasks: 

- We can run the queries we need for our Neotech customer
- We will be able to compare the previous Neotech Contract to the latest Neotech contract file and cross-reference the PARTNUM column from one week to the next to identify if there are any missing items from one week to the next
- Perform a Vlookup from any previous Contract if not done for the previous week file, so for instance we are comparing the 9.29 file but pulling in the data from the 8.04 file 
- Additionally, we are adding the latest awards, backlog, sales history, vpc, and snd files to the latest neotech contract file, such as we did for Creation Contract

1. Select the previous Neotech contract where we have our data that we want to send over to the target file
- For instance the last time we VLOOKUP'ed data from one file to the next was 8.24 that's where we have those 4 columns brought in
2. Then select the target file, this is the same one we have the 'Lost Items' sheet and the newly created Dupes Removed sheet 
3. Once the process is complete it will ask you where you'd like to save your final file
