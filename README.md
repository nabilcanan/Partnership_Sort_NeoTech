# Partnership_Sort_NeoTech


# Currently, we select the latest Neotech file and then the previous one 

    -We need to fix the issue where we need to check the latest neotechfile 
    
    -Ideally, once the process is completed for the last week file we can bring over the new VLOOKUP'ed columns 
    and bring them over
    
    -I need the week of 8.18 contract to have the Dupes Removed Sheet, with the VLOOKUP columns from the 8.04 
    contract in order to bring them into the next contract being 9.01
